# KeyboardPlus

This is a wireless keyboard helper.

Code is written in C# (Visual studio 2015) language.

The function of this program is to display the number pads status, capitalization  status and scroll status of the keyboard. 

Some wireless keyboards do not have keyboard status indicators. Display the keyboard status on the windows taskbar, making the operation more convenient.
